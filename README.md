It's been several months and it dawned on me on how to differentiate trading from
investing. By trading, we mean buying and trading securities and instruments like
stocks, mutual funds, forex, etf, etc. in the stock exchange market considering 
only volatility and price movements of "Stocks in Play". We don't care about
fundamentals and financial spriteness of companies only that "they are moving 
significantly". In contrast to investing, it is more involved and we immerse 
ourselves in researching and reviewing financial strengths that deliver income like
a cash cow.

When we invest, we want to live by the motto:

"Buy shares in a few high-quality, well-run businesses at a fairÂ price, and then hold
them forever."

Qualitatively speaking, we are looking for companies that fit these qualities:

1. Simple, easy-to-understand business 

2. Strong brand recognition 

3. Will be selling the same product or service 10 years from now 

4. Consumers need toÂ buy the product or serviceÂ again and againÂ  

5. Able to raise prices with inflation, or evenÂ more quickly

Quantitively speaking, we use financial techniques like ratios. My favorite is debt
to equity ratio. But for today, I will tweak it a little. We will spot on

There are many online sources to make the complex study easy. We don't want to 
complicate easy things and make them unbearably difficult. But we want to be in charge 
of our investment decisions when we risk our hard-earned monies. We can skim through 
Fidelity research, TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, and many more. 

Back to quantitavely speaking, we will need to convince ourselves on what we will 
uncover about financial truths enumerated , which are too many but narrow down on these
5 facts as follows:

1. Earnings show a smooth upward trend looking at EPS

2. Consistent return on equity (ROE) greater than 20% 

3. Consistent return on total capital (ROTC) greater than 15%

4. Long-term debt less than 4 times earnings 

5. Pays a dividend and/or buys back stock

Past winners maybe today's losers!
